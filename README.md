# face-recognition

The objective of this project is to bring a face recognition program into existence that would use the concepts of neural networks and deep learning. Face recognition is at present the most researched area in image processing domain. We also aim to make the project that will remain unaffected to the illumination of the image. This is particularly achieved by the concept of Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) algorithm for face detection. The image is irrespective of illumination is converted to grayscale and then processed further. The project is intended to be completed in three steps: first step is the creation of data set containing the facial images of the intended user. Second step will aim to train our model according to the dataset created in first step. Third step will be recognition of the face if found in the data set.  
It uses cascade classifier for the classification of faces into categories. Opencv and numpy are the major tools used in this project. opencv is the python library for real time computer vision particularly used for image processing using python. numpy on the other hand is another python library used for data analysis. The intended applications of this project are student identification in college and security.
